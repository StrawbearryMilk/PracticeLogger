This app stores the amount of time you are practicing, with a minimum of 15 minutes. After every 15 minutes, you receive a point which is saved to your account. Furthermore, the app also counts when you log in for multiple days in a row, multiplying the amount points you can score while practicing. 

This is still in the early phase, but I'm hoping to be done in about two weeks.
